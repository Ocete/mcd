#  Utility function that builds a matrix with given eigenvalues. This
#  is to be used to obtain the matrix A of the dynamic system that we
#  shall try to control with a Kalman filter.
#
#  The dimensionality of tha matrix will be congruent with the number
#  of eigenvalues that are desired. Note that there is a plethora
#  (viz., an infinite number) of matrices with the given eigenvalues,
#  depending on whet the eigenvectors are. This program will just
#  build one.
#
#  And... yes... I know... I could have done this in an easier way
#  using numpy. I didn't use it for two reasons:
#
#  i) I don't like to create dependencies on libraries just to do
#     something simple. A dependency on a library represents a cost
#     for that program, and a loss of self-standinghood (the word
#     doesn't exist, but it should). It is a price that I am not
#     wiling to pay to do something as simple as a few vector
#     multiplications.
#
#  ii) If I do something myself, I understand it better than having a
#      black box do it for me. Since this is not a production system,
#      I put a premium on understaning.

#
#  Builds an unitary matrix of given dimension. This is a bit
#  tricky. The idea is to start with a generic matrix, considering its
#  columns as vectors, and apply normalization and Grahm-Schmidt to
#  obtain a matrix with normalized, orthogonal vectors in the
#  columns. This, of course, can be done as long as the original
#  matrix is non-singular. But, how can we guarantee that?
#
#  Since this is a didactic program and no lives will be lost if it
#  fails, I decided to adopt the simpler and most obvious solution: I
#  generate a random matrix and hope for the best. Singular matrices
#  in low dimensions (we are not going to use this to create huge
#  matrices) are relatively rare so, crossing our fingers, things
#  should work out quite fine.
#
#  Another minor point:the matrix that we are to produce has to have
#  vectors in the columns, but the matrix with the initial vectors has
#  vectors in the rows, as this is simpler to manage in python. The
#  final orthogonal matrix will then be transposed to obtain the
#  vectors on the columns, as per standard.
#
#
#   Returns:
#
#   (U, UT)
#
#   where U is the unitary matrix with the vectors in the columns, and
#   UT its transpose (we need them both to compute the final matrix)
